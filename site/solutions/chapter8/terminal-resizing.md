## Terminal Resizing {.problem}

Sometimes users will want to resize their terminals while viewing a
document. This is a problem for our pager since we calculate the size of the
terminal exactly once at the start of the program. Update your program to allow
the user to resize the terminal while retaining their current place in the
document (the first word on the screen before resizing should still be the first
word on the screen after resizing, regardless of how much the screen space has
increased or decreased).

Note that detecting changes to the size of the terminal automatically will be
unreasonably difficult with the knowledge that you have learned so far in this
book, so you should handle terminal resizing by allowing the user to press a key
to reflow the text.
